  "educationalNotes": "Calcium forms your bones and teeth - your body contains ~1kg of calcium! Milk and dairy products are rich in Ca (important for growing children). Limestone (calcium carbonate) is used in construction, concrete, and as the main ingredient in chalk. Quicklime (calcium oxide) is produced by heating limestone - reacts with water to release heat (used in self-heating meal kits). Calcium-45 is radioactive isotope used in medical research. Soft water has less calcium than hard water."
