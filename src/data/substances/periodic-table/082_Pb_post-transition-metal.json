  "educationalNotes": "Lead is ancient metal - used by Romans 2,000 years ago (caused poisoning - contributed to decline!)! Lead is toxic - damages brain especially in children. Leaded gasoline (banned 1970s) caused widespread lead pollution. Lead shielding protects from radiation. Lead-acid car batteries power vehicles. Leaded solder banned in electronics (lead-free now standard). Lead piping in old houses contaminates drinking water. Still widely used but hazardous."
