  "educationalNotes": "Zinc is essential mineral - deficiency causes hair loss, poor wound healing, and weakened immunity! Galvanized steel (zinc-coated) prevents rust. Brass is copper + zinc alloy. Zinc supplements help colds (maybe). Zinc oxide is used in rubber and cosmetics. Penny coins (post-1982 US) are 97% zinc with copper coating. Zinc deficiency was common in developing countries but improved by fortifying flour. Body contains ~2.5g of zinc total.",
