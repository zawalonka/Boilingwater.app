  "educationalNotes": "Copper conducts electricity second only to silver - it's the standard for wiring in buildings and electronics. Turns green when oxidized (copper(II) oxide) - the Statue of Liberty is green because of this patina. Bronze (copper + tin) was used in early tools and weapons - gave the Bronze Age its name. Copper pipes carry water in homes. Gram-for-gram, copper kills bacteria better than silver - hence 'antimicrobial copper' in hospitals. Discovered and worked by humans since 8000 BCE."
