  "educationalNotes": "Most reactive element known - reacts with nearly everything! Fluorine gas was isolated in 1886 and immediately caused serious injuries (chemist Humphry Davy damaged his eyes and teeth). Added to toothpaste (0.1%) to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent cavities - has saved millions from dental decay. Uranium enrichment for nuclear reactors uses uranium hexafluoride (UF₆). CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) with fluorine damaged the ozone layer. Extremely toxic in high concentrations."
